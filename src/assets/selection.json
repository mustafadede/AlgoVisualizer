  "subTitle": "How Selection-sort works?",
  "steps": [
    "The list is divided into two parts: sorted and unsorted.",
    "Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.",
    "The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, and that element becomes a part of the sorted array.",
    "This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.",
    "The process continues until the entire list is sorted."
